The author of this test and the test framework is a member of [Manticore Search](https://manticoresearch.com/) core team and the test was initially made to compare Manticore Search with Elasticsearch, but as shown above and can be verified in the [open source code](https://github.com/db-benchmarks/db-benchmarks) and by running the same test yourself Manticore Search wasn't given any unfair advantage, so the test can be considered unprejudiced. However, if something is missing or wrong (i.e. non-objective) in the test feel free to make a pull request or an issue on [Github](https://github.com/db-benchmarks/db-benchmarks). Your take is appreciated! Thank you for spending your time reading this!
